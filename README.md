My attempt at using AI to make short-term predictions on the stock market. I've trained two models, a simple LSTM model and a more complex DeepAR model. DeepAR can use multiple time series as input and produces a probabilistic forecast making it ideal for predicting stocks. Using a top 10 strategy on the DeepAR model in testing outperformed the average profit increase of the stocks tested over the same 30 minutes almost 10 fold. The top 10 strategy yielded an average profit of 0.0568% over 30 mins compared to the average 0.00581% that the stock market grew over that time period. Using this strategy just 3 times a day (10 stocks per use of strategy) would yield a daily profit of 1.5%.

In addition to training ML models, I have also built two scanners which search for scenarios outlined in typical day trading strategies. The strategies chosen are the top reversal strategy and the VWAP support strategy. Both seem to work very well.
