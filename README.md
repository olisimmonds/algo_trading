My attempt at using AI to make short-term predictions on the stock market. This currently has two models, a simple LSTM model and a more complex DeepAR model. DeepAR can use multiple time series as input and produces a probabilistic forecast making it ideal for predicting stocks. I am looking to implement strategies and improve the performance of the DeepAR model.
